               When I say self-managed combat effects, I mean that the effects subscribe to the core combat management structure and react automatically to various action events that are broadcasted through the system. The reactions handle things like determining when effects should be applied or removed and how.
               <br><br>Thanks to the use of action events and reactive behavior, the combat system is very set-and-forget. New combat abilities can be created and configured modularly to behave in a wide range of ways without needing to alter the core combat system to account for them or integrate them explicitly.  
                <!--which includes creating structures for storing persistent game-data, scripts for parsing and translating that data into behavior at run-time based on how it is configured and based on the circumstances, and a network of event listeners so that combat effects are managed, reversed, and resolved in a passive way.
                <br>Combat Effects are the various immediate or lingering effects that occur as a result of using abilities in Combat. They are dynamically configured at runtime, based on an array of configurable features [insert inspector image?], and are designed to mostly manage themselves by subscribing to (and unsubscribing from) relevant C# and custom events that warrant some kind of change in them. 
                <br>Examples of the events that trigger and update the Effects are: 
                <ul>
                  <li>Removal Upon Death: When the player that the Effect is attached to dies, the Effect may react and remove itself.
                  <li>Expiration: After the alloted duration of the Effect has been exceeded (i.e. 60 seconds of Combat Time has passed since it was placed on the target), the Effect will react and remove itself.
                </ul>
                Based on the type of Effect and how it is configured, when the Effect is removed, it may reverse the changes it made on the target. For example, if a temporary +25% outgoing damage effect was applied to the target and it then expired, their damage modifier would be reduced by 25% when it was removed.

                <br>//scripted: Due to the other development priorities, we did not have time to develop tools to implement scripted movement or animations in a streamlined fashion. Therefore, scripted content I made did not include movement of NPCs and the like. Most of the scripted behavior is therefore based in behind-the-scenes logic-gates and involves instantaneous switching enabled or disabled object Interactions options, and toggling of various object properties like collision or visibility.

                Mechanically, tooltips are achieved with:
                <ul>
                  <li>A <strong class="light-bold">set of Tooltip components</strong> that dictate the format and content of any given UI element's Tooltip. They can be added to any UI element, either manually or programmatically at runtime. A number of the component's variables need to be configured in order for the Tooltip to populate properly.
                  <li>A <strong class="light-bold">UI layer</strong> for the Tooltips to be displayed upon, in front of all other UI.
                  <li><strong class="light-bold">Graphics Raycasting</strong> to detect when a UI element that has a Tooltip component on it is detected, which will cause a Tooltip to be generated. 
                  <li>A <strong class="light-bold">set of simple prefabs</strong> with primitive UI elements <strong class="light-bold">that are used to format and construct Tooltips</strong> and that are populated with relevant information or graphics.
                  <li>A <strong class="light-bold">method responsible for instantiating, formatting, and populating the Tooltip</strong> with relevant information. Each of the Tooltip components' methods are configured based on what is relevant given the content being shown and the context it's shown in.

                The kinds of efforts that I took to optimize the game include:
                <ul>
                  <li> <strong class="light-bold">Creating billboards for assets.</strong> I did this mostly for assets that had relatively-high geometry to them, using a tool called Amplify Imposters. Initially, I did it for most of the assets in the game, but I reigned my efforts back a bit on some of the simpler assets when I noticed having too many billboards led to a non-negligible increase in the overall file size. At that point, I tried to balance in-game performance with memory usage and file size.
                  <li> <strong class="light-bold">Occlusion of level areas.</strong> //
                  <li> <strong class="light-bold">Baking and configuring assets as static.</strong> //
                  <li> <strong class="light-bold">Simplifying geometry of assets.</strong> I did this where I was able to and where it didn't affect the quality of the assets very much. If I wasn't able to do this myself (if, for example, I didn't have access to the original file or the tools to edit them), I asked people who worked on the assets to send revised versions of them that had lower geometry counts.
                </ul>                
                <br><u>Reflection:</u>
                <br>I will note a limitation of my efforts: the game's second level (the Tower's Foundations) has considerable performance hiccups, especially on lower-end machines. Efforts were made to optimize the level and improve the performance, but we realized (too late) that the main cause of the problem was something that could not be resolved in any manageable way at that point. The primary issue was that the level was made using a singular (and quite large) Terrain tile. Having all of the level's assets tied to that Terrain tile's baking data meant that there was little we could do to cull unnecessary parts of the level (including distant, localized lighting) from the level's memory and rendered geometry. We believe it also led to significantly increased file sizes as a result of the baking amplifying the 'real' geometry of the level.

                I was responsible for building the game for different platforms, configuring Unity's build settings, resolving build errors as they arose, packaging and organizing the built game's different versions for our distribution and backup sites, and ensuring that the game in general and each of its systems functioned properly on different platforms.
                <br>
                <br>The following are examples of <strong>accomodations</strong> made to account for differences between and limitations of certain platforms and devices:
                <ul>
                  <li>Horizontal and vertical mouse input sensitivity sliders were added in the game's options to allow each player to calibrate the sensitivity as they need for their setup.

                Throughout development, I regularly tested the game to confirm that the functionality and scripted content being added behaved as expected. 
                <br>           
                <br>An outline of my general QA testing and bug-fixing process:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong class="light-bold">Implement features and new content</strong>.
                  <li><strong class="light-bold">Playtest the game</strong>, especially focusing on content, features, or fixes that were implemented since the last playtest.
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong class="light-bold">Record unexpected behavior</strong>, make guesses about root causes of the issue, <strong class="light-bold">and assign a preliminary priority level for the issue</strong> based on its prominence and severity.
                  </ul>                  
                  <li>Review the list of issues to consolidate similar issues, adjust priority levels, and ultimately <strong class="light-bold">indentify the most pressing ones</strong>.
                  <li>Work on <strong class="light-bold">implementing fixes</strong> for the most pressing issues.
                  <ul>
                    <li> Investigate the backend of the elements related to the issue to <strong class="light-bold">identify the root causes of the issue</strong>.
                    <li> If a root cause of the issue was found, add it as a sub-goal to the issue with it's own priority level.
                    <li> If I failed to identify any root causes behind an issue, I would leave its priority level as it was, make note of what I had considered or looked into as potential root causes, and then move on to the next issue, saving this one for a later pass.
                    <li> <strong class="light-bold">Make necessary changes</strong> to address any identified root causes.
                    <li> After implementing a change intended to resolve an issue, <strong class="light-bold">mark the issue as preliminarily-resolved</strong>, pending confirmation in an upcoming playtest.
                  </ul>
                  <li><strong class="light-bold">Repeat</strong>. 
                </ul>
                In reality, I have never been able to completely clear the list of issues. However, by focusing on addressing the issues with the highest priority, I've managed to regularly clear the list of all of the most pressing, game-breaking bugs.

                <br>Since I was also responsible for a significant portion of the game's programming and content design, I ended up having a fairly streamlined and comfortable iterative process with my own work. 
                <ul>
                  <li>This dynamic gave me additional insight into what was likely wrong when coming across any given bug, which was typically helpful for identifying and resolving issues quickly. 
                  <li>However, that the dynamic was also likely less than ideal due to my inherent bias and shortsightedness with regard to my own weaknesses of design and limited ability to mimic other people's playstyles. Had the roles been a bit more equitably divided, I likely would have identified more issues and recieved design feedback that was more critical of the various implementation choices I made for various content or systems. Unfortunately, our circumstances were not quite so ideal as to allow for that.

                <br>OLD The following adjustments were made to <strong>accomodation</strong> differences and limitations between platforms and devices:
                <ul>
                  <li>Overall, we did not need to accomodate different controls since all of the platforms we built for are regularly accompanied by a mouse and keyboard. 
                  <li>However, we did need to account for input sensitivity across different platforms and mice, as well as for the potential usage of a touchpad. We did this by tuning the sensitivity as best as we could, and by adding separate horizontal and vertical mouse input sensitivity sliders in the game's options to allow each player to calibrate the sensitivity as they need for their setup.
                  <li>We also had to consider different screen sizes/resolutions, which had caused some elements to scale or display improperly on different devices. The main thing we did to account for the differences here was making sure that the UI elements were configured with proper parenting and anchoring (which, admittedly, is essentially just proper practice).
                  <li>For PC, Mac, and Linux builds, the game's save data (savegames) were stored as readable files that were located relative to the application's location on the hard drive (see <strong style="color: brown;">*</strong> note for our general reasoning behind this approach). However, since reading and writing files between a browser and the local computer isn't nearly as straightforward, we had to make an adjustment to how the savegames were handled on our WebGL build. For our WebGL builds, the savegame data was saved as strings of JSON-formatted-data in the game's PlayerPrefs entry. This was not our optimal solution, but it was what we needed and were able to do given our limited experience and resources to make the game functional on WebGL. <i>Note: The accomodation for WebGL builds ultimately became irrelevant as building the game for WebGL became non-viable once the game's file size and memory usage increased as we compiled our levels and ran into complications with optimizing certains components of the game.</i>
                </ul>  

                <br>An outline of my general QA testing and bug-fixing process:
                <ul>
                  <li>Implement a component of a game system, add some functionality, or a prepare a piece of scripted or otherwise interactive content (such as a Combat Encounter).
                  <li>Play the game. This regularly involves interacting with the golden path to ensure that progression hasn't broken, in addition to any new features, content, or fixes that have been added since the last test.
                  <ul>
                    <li>While playing, I would note anything behaved unexpectedly. I would also try to make informed guesses as to what was likely causing the issue and make note of the suspicions, so that they could be looked into later. Finally, I assigned a preliminary priority<strong style="color:orange">*</strong> level to the issue.
                  </ul>                  
                  <li>After playing, I would look through the list of issues I had accumulated, indentify and look into the most pressing ones, and try to resolve them as quickly as possible, or at least identify what the root cause of the unexpected behavior was.
                  <ul>
                    <li> Whenever I identified a root cause of the issue, I would create a sub-goal with it's own priority that outlined the issue and any changes I needed to make.
                    <li> If made an attempt to resolve an issue by implementing a change, I would mark it's priority as preliminarily-resolved. Issues marked with this priority need to be tested in a future playtest to confirm that the issue has actually been resolved, or if there are other root causes of the issue, or unintended consequences that began following the attempt to resolve it.
                    <li> If I was unable to identify the cause of the unexpected behavior, I left the issue listed as it was so that I could come back to it later on, with notes on what I had already considered the issue to be and confirmed it not to be.
                  </ul>
                  <li>Repeat the process of playtesting to find more issues to resolve or adjustments to make. 
                  <li>Occasionally look through the list of issues to see if any have either been resolved by the various changes I made elsewhere or if there were duplicate/similar issues identified, as well as to see if an issue should be changed to have a higher or lower priority level based on upcoming milestone expectations. 
                </ul>
                In reality, I have never been able to completely clear the list of issues. However, by focusing on addressing the issues with the highest priority, I've managed to regularly clear the list of all of the most pressing, game-breaking bugs.  
                <br><br>
                <strong style="color:orange">*</strong> The priority given to an issue was based on things like: how replicable it seemed to be, how likely it was that the player would be to come across the problem, how widespread the issue was, how much of an impact it had on standard gameplay behavior, how much it hindered the player's ability to advance through (or even play) the game, and how it would affect our ability to meet any upcoming milestone goals or deadlines we had.

                The game's data is stored in persistent ScriptableObjects. The kinds of things that are stored include items, abilities, quest details, and character stats.
                <br>Using ScriptableObjects means that the data is stored in a database of sorts. Not only did this improve organization by centralizing the data and allowing changes to be made easily, but because it was a database, I was able to develop tools that would reference the databases' information and dynamically populate the various UI elements throughout the game at runtime. This meant that, after configuring and programming those tools, I was able to apply them in numerous places through the game and have them do the work for me, work that I otherwise would have had to manually input.
                <br>In the case of the inventory, quest journal, and the equipment and ability lists, I was able to doubly automate that. First, the player's save data is read to populate the buttons that are present, and then those buttons

        v1
        <br><b>Most of the User Interface is Populated Dynamically at Runtime</b> 
        <br>Because of how I organized the game's data (item, ability, and quest details, character stat sheets), I was able to develop systems that automatically populated most of the player's user interfaces with only the information relevant to them based on their progress and their situational context. 
        <br><small>For example, only Quests that have been started will appear in the Quest Journal and those that have been completed will appear at the bottom, only items that have been collected will appear in the Inventory, only Equipment that can be equipped by a character will appear in the Character Management window, and only the abilities that the character either has learned, has access to through items, or is able to learn will appear in their Abilities list. Additionally, all of the tooltips in the game are dynamically generated at runtime, interpreting the variables associated with the specific piece of data being looked at (an item, an ability, and in-combat effect) and formatting that information according to a handful of templates.</small>
        <br><br>This design approach streamlined many of the aspects of content production, allowing a person to configure something like a piece of equipment without needing to understand how the tooltip is made and without understanding how the abilities and stats added to the equipment gets inherited by the characters that equip it.
        <br><br>It's not necessarily a major achievement in the sense that I was the first person to build the infrastructure for a game in this way, but because I came up with the idea mostly own my own after evaulating the needs of the project and considering the tools, classes, and data structures I was familiar with and/or used before. As I made it, and retrospectively looking back on it after engaging with a number of other tools that manage core game systems, I realized that the model I was using definitely resembled what has to be a common approach in the industry.

Also used for combat Effects. Handled through a set of centralized manager scripts. //I also set up a lot of event listeners at runtime in order to provide self-referential functionality to things like procedurally generated UI elements; diverting a lot of the implementation of functionality that is common but still varied depending on specifics to be handled by automatic processes helped to open my mind to more efficient practices overall that can reduce the amount of input needed by a designer.
